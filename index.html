            <p>The ankh has a T-shape topped by a droplet-shaped loop. It was used in writing as a triliteral sign, 
            representing a sequence of three consonants, Ꜥ-n-ḫ. This sequence was found in several Egyptian words,
            including the terms for "mirror", "floral bouquet", and "life". The symbol often appeared in Egyptian
            art as a physical object representing either life or related substances such as air or water. Commonly
            depicted in the hands of ancient Egyptian deities, sometimes being given by them to the pharaoh, it 
            represents their power to sustain life and to revive human souls in the afterlife.</p>
